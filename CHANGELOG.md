# Changelog

## 0.9.0 - 2025-07-01

**Significant cleanup - removed code we ended up not using as none of the councils are actually concerned about server load**

* Refactored example code into simple callable methods
* Expand test for geocodeable addresses to include comma between postcode and state at the end of the address.

### Added
- `ScraperUtils::SpecSupport.validate_addresses_are_geocodable!` - validates percentage of geocodable addresses
- `ScraperUtils::SpecSupport.validate_descriptions_are_reasonable!` - validates percentage of reasonable descriptions
- `ScraperUtils::SpecSupport.validate_uses_one_valid_info_url!` - validates single global info_url usage and availability
- `ScraperUtils::SpecSupport.validate_info_urls_have_expected_details!` - validates info_urls contain expected content
- `ScraperUtils::MathsUtils.fibonacci_series` - generates fibonacci sequence up to max value
- `bot_check_expected` parameter to info_url validation methods for handling reCAPTCHA/Cloudflare protection
- Experimental Parallel Processing support
  - Uses the parallel gem with subprocesses
  - Added facility to collect records in memory
  - see docs/parallel_scrapers.md and docs/example_parallel_scraper.rb
- .editorconfig as an example for scrapers

### Fixed
- Typo in `geocodable?` method debug output (`has_suburb_stats` â†’ `has_suburb_states`)
- Code example in `docs/enhancing_specs.md`

### Updated
- `ScraperUtils::SpecSupport.acceptable_description?` - Accept 1 or 2 word descriptors with planning specific terms
- Code example in `docs/enhancing_specs.md` to reflect new support methods
- Code examples
- geocodeable? test is simpler - it requires
  - a street type
  - an uppercase word (assumed to be a suburb) or postcode and
  - a state
- Support for 1 or 2 word "reasonable" descriptions that use words specific to planning alerts
- Added extra street types

### Removed
- Unsued CycleUtils
- Unused DateRangeUtils
- Unused RandomizeUtils
- Unused Scheduling (Fiber and Threads)
- Unused Compliant mode, delays for Agent (Agent is configured with an agent string)
- Unused MechanizeActions
